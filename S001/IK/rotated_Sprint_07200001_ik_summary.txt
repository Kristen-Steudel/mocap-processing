  - WARNING: Trial segmentation was not enabled, but the time range of trial "rotated_Sprint_07200001" where markers are present and force was non-zero is not equal to the full time range of the trial. We recommend enabling trial segmentation, which will trim this trial to the time range [0.065, 3.145]..
  - WARNING: Trial rotated_Sprint_07200001 was trimmed to the intersection of the marker and force plate data, ([0.0, 3.175]), since the time ranges in the uploaded files did not match..
