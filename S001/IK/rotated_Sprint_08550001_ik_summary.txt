  - WARNING: Marker Sternum jumps a suspiciously large 0.352667m on frame 476.
  - WARNING: Marker r.ASIS jumps a suspiciously large 0.222168m on frame 476.
  - WARNING: Marker r.PSIS jumps a suspiciously large 0.283030m on frame 476.
  - WARNING: Marker r_sh4 jumps a suspiciously large 0.446628m on frame 476.
  - WARNING: Marker r_thigh5 jumps a suspiciously large 0.356245m on frame 476.
  - WARNING: Trial segmentation was not enabled, but the time range of trial "rotated_Sprint_08550001" where markers are present and force was non-zero is not equal to the full time range of the trial. We recommend enabling trial segmentation, which will trim this trial to the time range [0.11, 2.25]..
  - WARNING: Trial rotated_Sprint_08550001 was trimmed to the intersection of the marker and force plate data, ([0.005, 2.385]), since the time ranges in the uploaded files did not match..
