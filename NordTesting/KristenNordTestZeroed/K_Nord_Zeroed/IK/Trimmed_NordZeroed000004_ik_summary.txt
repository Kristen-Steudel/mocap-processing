Trial 'Trimmed_NordZeroed000004': Inverse Kinematics Summary
----------------------------------------------------------------

Automatic processing achieved the following marker errors, averaged
over all frames of this trial:

  - Avg. Marker RMSE      = 1.80 cm
  - Avg. Marker Max Error = 7.21 cm

Markers with large root-mean-square error:

  - WARNING: Marker C7 has RMSE = 7.02 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker L_mankle has RMSE = 4.61 cm!
  - WARNING: Marker r_mankle has RMSE = 4.30 cm!

The input data for the following markers were modified to enable
automatic processing:

  - WARNING: Marker "L_wrist_radius" seems it was swapped with "L_wrist_ulna" for the whole clip..
  - WARNING: Trial segmentation was not enabled, but the time range of trial "Trimmed_NordZeroed000004" where markers are present and force was non-zero is not equal to the full time range of the trial. We recommend enabling trial segmentation, which will trim this trial to the time range [0.0, 9.545]..
  - WARNING: Trial Trimmed_NordZeroed000004 was trimmed to the intersection of the marker and force plate data, ([0.0, 9.545]), since the time ranges in the uploaded files did not match..
